# Description
The program visualizes the most common sorting algorithms using `matplotlib`'s `FuncAnimation` method. Furthermore for User Interface purposes I used `tkinter` module, and another addition module `random`.





## Setup

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install tkinter, matplotlib and random.

```
pip install tkinter
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```
```
pip install random
```


## Usage

You could use the program to understand how each algotigthm works, or sorts a list!

After setup; run the code, you must see the following window,

![figure](Images/tkinter.1.png) ![figure](Images/tkinter.2.png) 

here you choose the size of array and sorting algorithm. Then hit **Animate**.

This the first stage of process, program keep repeating the sorting until it is fully sorted.

The program has completed the visualization!
